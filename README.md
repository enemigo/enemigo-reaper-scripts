simple lua scripts for me



How to install: https://forums.cockos.com/showpost.php?p=2190641&postcount=12


If you want to install them manually:
Put the lua files into (a subfolder of) the Scripts folder in the Reaper resource path (Options > Show Reaper resource path ...)
Load the lua files via the Action List into the [Main] Sections mentioned above
Assign these actions to a key shortcut, a toolbar button, a menu, etc.
